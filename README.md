# evolution-app
An iOS app built with Swift to provide an interactive way for students to learn about anatomically modern humans and their characteristics

This iOS app was created as a final project for my introductory anthropology class and is a representation of the evolutionary path that anatomically modern humans, or Homo sapiens, evolved from in a quiz-like style to encourage interaction from students.

Students are intended to take the quiz through which their answers will be recorded and they will be shown what evolutionary ancestor of modern Homo sapiens their characteristics match the most with. In addition to this matching of overall similarities, in an effort to expose students to all the different evolutionary ancestors and their features, after answering each question a profile image of the species that the answer chosen most matches for that question appears. This profile image is tappable and when tapped proceeds to show an overview of the species or characteristic and how that characteristic may or may not be seen in modern humans today.

This project was designed as a rough draft for my final project and as such is not polished in terms of design or functionality. Thus:

The user will almost always match up with the characteristics of a member from the Homo genus the most as there is not an equal amount of opportunities given to match with other evolutionary ancestors.
The app is best displayed in the standard Xcode iPhone 11 simulator and has not been adapted to different screen sizes or physical phone screens.
If you are encouraged to take this app and polish it up to use for your class or students as a learning tool, please feel free as this was designed with the student in mind. The material asked in the questions require some background in anthropology, however, and may be more geared towards college-level students.

I utilized a multitude of different sources in order to gather information on and images of the 12 different species and multiple different human characteristics discussed in this project, which can be viewed at this link: https://pastebin.com/5v2egQTj
