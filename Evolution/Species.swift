struct Species {
    static var teethTypes = "Teeth that early humans have possessed have differed greatly from species to species\n\nBranches of species evolved to have larger jaws and stronger rear teeth to cut through even tougher vegetation, as seen in Paranthropus species or Australopithecus\n\nHowever, the Homo species have evolved to have smaller teeth as a result of a less prognathic face and the ability to prepare food to be softer with fire"
       
      static var sexualDimorphism = "Sexual dimorphism is an important characteristic in species because it helps members of the species communicate to others what their role in society is\n\nSexual dimorphism usually appears in the physical appearances of the different sexes\n\nMost members of the human evolutionary line are sexually dimorphic, however, one of our earliest ancestors, the Australopithecus anamensis, is not"
       
      static var toothInfo = "Early humans didn't actually have sharp and pointy teeth, like one might expect a caveman to have for eating prey that he hunts\n\nWhile it is true that humans are fantastic hunters, we tend to see early humans having flatter and more stout teeth, indicating a preference of eating vegetation or fruits"
       
      static var toolsUsage = "The first usage of tools was a big milestone in human history because it corresponded to an advancing species\n\nIt is believed that the species Australopithecus garhi was among the first hominids to use tools\n\nWhile the first usage of tools was indeed a big milestone, it is not to be confused with the first PRODUCTION of tools, which was what truly set humans apart"
       
      static var toolsProduction = "The first production of tools marked a point in human history where humans began to excel intellectually beyond other animals\n\nThe creation of tools by early humans signifies the ability of these toolmakers for innovation, dexterity, and certain mental skills that were not prevalent in other animals\n\nThe first stone tools created were called Acheulean tools which consisted of hammers and sharpened stones"
       
      static var socialLife = "One of the most distinguishing features about modern humans and humanity itself is humans' natural tendency to form strong social connections with others\n\nThe ability for humans to pass down knowledge from one generation to another helps later generations advance living conditions, technology, and their societies by not having to spend time relearning previously learned knowledge"
       
      static var language = "While other species can communicate, like birds with songs and calls and primates with gestures and sounds, none are able to formulate spoken language like humans can\n\nSpoken language is believed to have evolved around 30,000-100,000 years ago as a means of improving early humans' survival\n\nBeing able to use spoken language meant that our ancestors were able to share knowledge, share ideas, and more efficiently farm, hunt, and forage"
       
      static var ardipithecus = "Ardipithecus ramidus (or ardi) is an early proto-human that is primarily forest-dwelling and shares characteristics with chimps and gorillas\n\nArdi is not considered a part of the direct lineage of homo sapiens but rather a branch off of the main line\n\nArdi had a separated big toe able to grasp trees but also made it hard to walk long distances, meaning they usually spent a lot of their time climbing trees"
       
      static var anamensis = "Some noticeable characteristics of Australopithecus anamensis is its expanded shin bone, long forearms, strong jaws, and brain slightly larger than that of a chimp\n\nThe humerus of the Australopithecus anamensis signifies to anthropologists that it was not a predominately quadrupedal creature and instead walked bipedally or climbed\n\nWhile Australopithecus anamensis had better ability to walk upright than other species, it lived in forests and woodlands spending most of its time climbing trees to find food and avoid predators"
       
      static var afarensis = "Australopithecus afarensis is one of the longest-lived and most known about early human!\n\nThis species was one of the first early humans to regularly walk upright on two legs, however, still possess strong curved fingers perfect for climbing trees\n\nThese adaptations to their environment are what allowed them to survive for almost a million years\n\nAustralopithecus afarensis' small brains but the ability to habitually walk upright gives us insight into bipedalism developing before larger brains in humans"
       
      static var aethiopicus = "Paranthropus aethiopicus diverges from the lineage of homo sapiens and is considered to lead to an evolutionary dead end\n\nEvidence for this comes from the fact that Paranthropus aethiopicus possessed a strongly protruding face, large teeth, a powerful jaw, and a well-defined sagittal crest on the top of the skull, indicating huge chewing muscles\n\nMeanwhile, in other early human species around the same time, jaws and teeth were getting smaller to make way for larger brains"
       
      static var garhi = "Australopithecus garhi is not a part of the direct lineage of homo sapiens, however, it possesses many of the same characteristics that early humans possessed\n\nThey were one of the first species found to use tools, as indicated by antelope bones with cut marks in them believed to be made by Australopithecus garhi\n\nOne interesting feature of Australopithecus garhi is its elongated femur, allowing for more lengthy strides while walking bipedally"
       
      static var africanus = "Australopithecus africanus shows the shift towards the Homo genus in possessing smaller anterior teeth, smaller jaws, less prognathic face, and a larger brain\n\nAustralopithecus africanus possessed a pelvis adapted for walking bipedally and feet intermediate between that of a chimp and that of a human but still had long chimp-like arms which allowed them to climb trees effectively"
       
      static var robustus = "Paranthropus robustus is considered an evolutionary dead end and is not a part of the direct lineage of Homo sapiens\n\nA key characteristic of Paranthropus robustus is its very large teeth with thick enamel and steeply arched cheekbones allowing for the presence of huge chewing muscles\n\nThese adaptations allowed Paranthropus robustus to chew down on hard, fibrous foods\n\nAn interesting fact is that 'robust,' in the context of this species, is known to refer to its strong jaw and teeth, not its body"
       
      static var boisei = "Paranthropus boisei is considered an evolutionary dead end and is characterized by its skull that was specialized for chewing\n\nIt possessed a very strong sagittal crest at the top of its skull which allowed it to make full use of its strong chewing muscles and large jaw\n\nFlaring cheekbones allowed Paranthropus boisei's face to accommodate for teeth four times the size of an anatomically modern human's!"
       
      static var habilis = "Homo habilis is the first member of the Homo genus, and represents key features seen in humans today: a larger braincase and smaller face and teeth than that seen in previous generation's Australopithecus genus\n\nA fun fact is that this species is named 'handy man' because it is believed to be the first maker of stone tools, and, if you'll remember, the production of tools indicates that humans have the dexterity and mental ability not prevalent in other species across the globe"
       
      static var erectus = "Homo erectus is the first early human species believed to have anatomically modern human-like proportions, which include elongated legs and shorter arms about the size of the torso\n\nThese features are indications of a life lived on the ground, representing a loss of being able to climb\n\nHomo erectus possessed features that suggested a shift towards an increase in endurance and running speed, features that make humans great hunters\n\nHomo erectus is believed to be the first human species to leave Africa and have controlled use of fire!"
       
      static var neanderthalensis = "Homo neanderthalensis represents a big shift towards characteristics that we consider today to make us 'human'\n\nHomo neanderthalensis left behind evidence of being able to control fire, making and wearing clothing, and occasionally making symbolic or ornamental objects, which could be considered the first sign of acknowledged culture\n\nHomo neanderthalensis also practiced symbolic behavior by deliberately burying their dead and sometimes marking their grave symbolically"
       
      static var sapiens = "Homo sapiens is currently the only surviving member of the Homo genus and makes up everyone on the planet!\n\nAbout 300,00 years ago, Homo sapiens evolved in Africa after a dramatic climate change, and existed for a while along Homo neanderthalensis, which was believed to be outsmarted by Homo sapiens\n\nAnatomically modern humans have lighter skeleton builds and very large brains that have allowed for the existence of characteristics that set us apart from our ancestors\n\nHomo sapiens' ability to create and understand symbolic messages, create strong social bonds between members, care for young and old, and use knowledge to advance our societies are just a few of the things that make us human"
